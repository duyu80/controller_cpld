@W: MT462 :"e:\work\controller_cpld\bld\..\src\i2c.v":122:43:122:48|Net I2C_INST.un1_CNT8 appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :"e:\work\controller_cpld\bld\..\src\i2c.v":122:43:122:82|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 8 sequential elements including I2C_INST.CHECKSUM_OUT[7:0].  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\work\controller_cpld\bld\..\ip\usr_mem.v":76:10:76:24|Found inferred clock TOP|SYSCLK_inferred_clock which controls 417 sequential elements including i_efb_ufm_top.UUT.inst2.USR_MEM_0_0_0_0. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
